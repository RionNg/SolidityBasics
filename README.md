# Solidity Basics

Welcome to the "Solidity Basics" repository!
This guide provides an introduction to the fundamentals of Solidity, the programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

Solidity is a statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
Smart contracts are self-executing contracts where the terms are directly written into code.
